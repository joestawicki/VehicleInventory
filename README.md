# Vehicle Inventory

This is a small-scale Vehicle Inventory console application written in C#.

Upon execution, it will populate the vehicle inventory with some sample vehicle data, will print all vehicles in the inventory,
and then will print all vehicles that require oil changes given sample criteria.
